# Exmach

Data Science From Scratch in `Elixir`. Modeled after the fantastic [Data Science From Scratch](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python/dp/149190142X) book by Joel Grus, and adopted for Elixir. The code in this library can be used in your own `Elixir` machine learning and Data Science projects

## Installation
